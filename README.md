# AI Data Analyst Agent

This project is a fully autonomous AI Data Analyst Agent. It exposes a powerful API that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and execute complex data analysis tasks on the fly. The agent can source data from the web, prepare it, perform statistical analysis, and generate visualizations based on a simple natural language prompt.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Dynamic Task Execution:** Understands natural language requests and generates Python code to solve them.
-   **Data Sourcing:** Can scrape data from web pages.
-   **File Analysis:** Accepts and analyzes uploaded files (e.g., `.csv`) and uses them as a primary data source.
-   **Advanced Data Analysis:** Uses `pandas` and `scikit-learn` to perform calculations, correlations, and other statistical analyses.
-   **Dynamic Visualization:** Generates plots and charts using `matplotlib` and returns them as base64-encoded data URIs.
-   **API-Based:** Built with FastAPI, making it easy to integrate with other services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
-   **AI / Agent Framework:** LangChain
-   **LLM Provider:** Groq (using `llama3-8b-8192`)
-   **Core Data Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib
-   **Deployment:** Render / Vercel
